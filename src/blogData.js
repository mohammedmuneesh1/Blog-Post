        "Even if you‘re not sure what a blog is, you’ve no doubt come across one at some point in time. Perhaps you‘ve stumbled across a blog when you’ve searched “healthy dinner recipes”. In fact, if you're reading this, guess what? You're on a blog. (Very meta, I know.) <br/>The word blog is a combined version of the words “web” and “log.” At their inception, blogs were simply an online diary where people could keep a log about their daily lives on the web. They have since morphed into an essential forum for individuals and businesses alike to share information and updates.Different types of blogs cover varying topics, from food and fashion to marketing. Blogs are composed of individual posts on more specific subjects within the blog’s field of expertise. To get started with blogs on social media, check out microblogging. These posts often serve as a platform for discussions, as many blogs have active comments sections. You can think of a blog almost as a newspaper that adds articles and continually maintains the archive. ",

        "Every blogger has experienced “blogging drought.” This is not an unusual scenario. In fact, majority of bloggers experience the lull of blogging and the scarcity of readers. You published a well-written blog post and expected (and hoped) others to see, read, share and comment on it. But instead, you got NOTHING. It would seem like no one is even paying attention to your blog, let alone read your article and share it. The blogging drought phenomenon happens all the time, particularly with company blogs. In most niches and industries, you’ll be in competition with hundreds (if not thousands) of other bloggers for the attention of a small pool of readers. To stand out from the rest, your blog must be truly one of a kind in all aspects – design, content, marketing, and so on. Making an exceptional blog that receives ample traffic requires serious time, dedication and money. Based on an article posted on the New York Times, roughly 95% of blogs fail. If you really want to make your blog work, you must beat this hostile statistic. The first thing you must focus on is increasing your blog traffic. The key here is to generate RELEVANT and TARGETED traffic. Receiving “more traffic” won’t always get you the results you want unless the increased traffic is pertinent to your brand and niche. Here are tried-and-tested tips and ideas on how to boost relevant traffic to your blog.",
